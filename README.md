# Energy Community Smartwatch Prototype

This project explores the concept of **energy communities** through a minimal, energy-efficient smartwatch application. It aims to combine fast data retrieval with elegant implementation of complex infrastructure in a user-friendly app.

---

## Personal Goals

- **Learn about energy communities:** From the basic idea to full realizationâ€”understanding what they are and how they function, including the data moving through the infrastructure.  
- **Improve IoT data collection and processing skills:** Gain hands-on experience in gathering, handling, and analyzing data for energy-related applications.  
- **Master Docker:** Not only using Docker containers but also writing custom `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose.yml` for complex setups.

---

## Primary Project Goals

- **Fast data retrieval:** Ensure that data flows quickly and efficiently from the energy community network to the app.  
- **Energy-efficient smartwatch app:** Since this is for an energy-focused company, the app itself needs to consume minimal energy.  
- **Elegant minimal implementation:** Convey complex infrastructure and data processing pipelines in a simple and intuitive app interface.

## Tech Stack

### Current Prototype
- **Messaging & Data Collection:** NATS JetStream with a manual aggregator.  
- **Backend API:** Python + FastAPI.  
- **Aggregator:** Python script for simple data aggregation.  

### Notes for Production
- **Messaging & Data Processing:** Kafka + Kafka Streams for robust, time-series oriented, event-driven pipelines.  
- **Backend API:** Node.js for reliability and performance in production environments.  
- **Aggregator:** Java, compatible with Kafka Streams.  
- **Analytics:** OLAP databases would be considered if advanced analytics are required.

## Summary

This prototype demonstrates a **lightweight, energy-efficient smartwatch app** for energy communities. While the prototype uses Python and NATS JetStream for simplicity, the architecture is designed to scale with production-ready technologies like Kafka and Node.js, while keeping efficiency and elegant design in mind.
